I've selected three wallpapers I've actually used.

The first one is about the best trilogy of all time and that's obviously Lord Of The Rings

The second one is just a fun one where Jules and Vincent from Pulp Fiction shoot up an arcade instead of people for once...

And the last one is right in the nostalgia with tech that I grew up with as a child.
